Description
  cfdemSolverIB is a coupled CFD-DEM solver using CFDEMcoupling, an open
  source parallel coupled CFD-DEM framework, for calculating the dynamics
  between immersed bodies and the surrounding fluid. Being an implementation
  of an immersed boundary method it allows tackling problems where the body
  diameter exceeds the maximal size of a fluid cell. Using the toolbox of
  OpenFOAMÂ®(*) the governing equations of the fluid are computed and the
  corrections of velocity and pressure field with respect to the body-
  movement information, gained from LIGGGHTS, are incorporated.
